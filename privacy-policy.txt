Privacy Policy for EonDev

Last Updated: November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how EonDev (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Windows AI assistant application (“the App”).

By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

1. Information We Collect
a. Audio & Recording Data

When you grant microphone access, EonDev records and transcribes audio during meetings to generate notes, summaries, and real-time AI suggestions.

Recordings are processed through our secure servers and analyzed by our AI model (Gemini).

You can delete recordings and transcripts at any time from within the App.

b. Screen & OCR Data

When you use OCR features (e.g., for contextual AI suggestions), EonDev captures a screenshot of your current window.

The screenshot is temporarily processed by a local Tauri plugin, compressed, and securely transmitted to our server for analysis by the AI model.

Images and OCR results are deleted automatically after processing unless you save them manually.

c. Chat Data

Chats between you and the AI assistant are stored on our servers to maintain context and improve your experience.

You may delete individual conversations or clear all chat data from your account.

d. Account & Usage Data

If you create an account, we collect:

Email address and login credentials

Subscription and billing data (if applicable)

Basic usage analytics (e.g., frequency of feature use, performance logs)

We do not collect or sell personally identifiable information beyond what’s required to operate the App.

2. How We Use Your Data

We use your data to:

Provide AI-powered transcription, summarization, OCR, and contextual assistance

Improve accuracy and reliability of the App

Manage your account and preferences

Process payments and subscriptions

Provide customer support and troubleshooting

We do not sell, rent, or trade user data to third parties.

3. Data Storage and Retention

All user data (recordings, transcripts, chats) are stored securely on encrypted servers.

Data is retained until you delete it manually or close your account.

Exported notes or files stored locally are not accessible to us.

4. Data Sharing

We may share limited data with:

AI processing providers (e.g., Google’s Gemini API) solely to generate AI outputs.

Payment processors (if applicable) for billing and verification.

Analytics or error monitoring tools to improve performance.

These partners are bound by strict confidentiality and data-protection agreements.

We will never share or disclose your personal data except as required by law.

5. Security

We employ industry-standard security measures including:

End-to-end encryption during transmission

Secure storage and anonymization of sensitive data

Access controls and user authentication

However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute data security.

6. Your Rights

You have the right to:

Access, download, or delete your stored data

Withdraw recording permissions at any time

Request correction of inaccurate information

Close your account permanently

To exercise these rights, contact us at [your support email].

7. Children’s Privacy

EonDev is not intended for individuals under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted within the App and on our official website. Continued use after an update constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
